# 4d mesh slice vertex shader
Currently almost best way to generate 4d slice by vertex shader,which has generate 10000 4d objects in c++ environment by opengl in lower laptop at 30hz frame/s by me.If each 4d object has 50 tetras be used(if using texture or buffer to replace a bunch of "if" cases,one object can bind 500 tetras),it can generate 500,000 or  5,000,000(one object can run with 10,000,000 or 100,000,000 4d tetras) 4d tetras even more by valkan.So,it is a break through in dimension and quantity,it can be used in almost all game engines if you want.
